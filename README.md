# Flower Pollination Algorithm

## Overview
The Flower Pollination Algorithm simulates the pollination process of flowers to find optimal solutions for complex problems. This implementation provides a basic framework for applying FPA to various optimization tasks.

## Project Structure
* `FPA Python Code.py`: Python implementation of the Flower Pollination Algorithm
* `Flower Pollination Algorithm Report.pdf`: Detailed report on the algorithm, its inspiration, and its applications

## Usage
1. Run the `FPA Python Code.py` file
2. Run it in VS Code for a better experience

## Requirements
* Python 3.11.9
